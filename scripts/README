First initialize CMSSW environment for a CMSSW release that is
accessible from the worker nodes (e.g. in AFS).  Example:

cd ~/CMSSW_4_2_2_patch1
export SCRAM_ARCH=slc5_amd64_gcc434
eval `scramv1 runtime -sh`


Then move to a scratch directory for condor to write job files to for this job.

Create the submit file.

condor_cmsRun  --file-list=dataset1 /path/to/cmsRun_discard_output.sh /path/to/merge_cfg.py maxEvents=10

condor_submit submit

In our cluster in T2_US_Wisconsin, we have some batch slots configured
for fast scheduling of analysis jobs.  To use those, we can simply
add a few condor commands when generating the submit file:

condor_cmsRun  --file-list=dataset1 'requirements = IsFastSlot' '+IsFastQueueJob=true'  /path/to/cmsRun_discard_output.sh /path/to/merge_cfg.py maxEvents=10
